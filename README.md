# Keon Evidence Vault

⚠️ **Write-once. Read-only. Verifiable.**

This repository is the **append-only evidence vault** for Keon-governed workflows.  
It stores sealed evidence packs, receipts, and verification artifacts that prove
*what happened*, *under which policy*, and *under whose authority*.

**Execution proposes. Governance decides. Receipts prove.**

See [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md) for permitted and prohibited use.

## What Is an Evidence Vault?

An **evidence vault** is a repository designed to store **sealed, immutable proof**
of governed system behavior.

In Keon, evidence vaults exist to ensure that:
- outcomes can be independently verified
- decisions are attributable to explicit human authority
- system behavior can be audited without trust in narratives or logs

**Evidence stands on its own. Verification is the source of truth.**

This repository is intentionally **append-only**. Existing artifacts must never be
modified or replaced. New runs produce new evidence.

## What This Repository Is

This repository contains:
- Sealed evidence packs (`sealed.zip`)
- Deterministic receipts (`receipts.jsonl`)
- Human decision records (`directive_receipts.json`)
- Policy versions applied during execution
- Integrity manifests and cryptographic hashes

These artifacts are generated by **policy-driven, Keon-governed workflows**.

Git history is **not** the authority.  
Cryptographic verification is.
