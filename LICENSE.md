# Evidence Use Notice

This repository contains sealed evidence packs, receipts, and verification artifacts
generated by Keon-governed workflows.

## Permitted Use
- Viewing and downloading evidence artifacts
- Independent verification of hashes and integrity
- Referencing artifacts for audit, review, or evaluation purposes

## Prohibited Use
- Modifying or altering evidence artifacts
- Republishing modified versions of artifacts
- Creating derivative works that imply altered meaning, endorsement, or certification
- Representing these artifacts as guarantees beyond what they explicitly prove

## Integrity
Evidence artifacts are cryptographically sealed. Verification should be performed
using the included manifests and hashes. Git history is not the source of truth.

## No Warranty
Artifacts are provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind. The presence of an
artifact does not imply fitness for any purpose beyond verifiable integrity.

For questions regarding permitted use, contact the repository maintainers.
